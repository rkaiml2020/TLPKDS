# üîê Timelock-PKDS: Private Key Disclosure Scheme for Non-Attributable Email Framework (NAEF)

## üìñ Overview
Email breaches are a prevalent issue, exposing sensitive personal, business, and political data. The situation is worsened by email‚Äôs inherent attributability, where attackers can easily prove the authenticity of stolen messages, thanks to protocols like DKIM designed to prevent spam and spoofing. This attribution increases the potential for harm, as attackers can sell stolen data, blackmail victims, or publicly release sensitive emails
with cryptographic proof of authenticity. This paper introduces Timelock-PKDS, a new scheme that fundamentally defines the forgeability of email authenticity after a set time period. Leveraging timelock puzzles, Timelock-PKDS provides a partial disclosure of the private key embedded in
the email‚Äôs X-header. The private key is encrypted, ensuring it remains secure but can be decrypted after the designated time has passed. This partial key disclosure enables delayed forgeability, allowing the authenticity of the email to be contested and forged only after the timelock expires. We formally define this concept of time-bound forgeability and propose the Timelock- PKDS scheme, which balances the need for secure communication with the ability for delayed forgery. Additionally, we evaluate the scheme‚Äôs performance, including its verification speed and bandwidth overhead, showing its practical viability for secure yet time-sensitive email systems.

This Node.js project implements a secure email communication system with support for timelocked private key fragments, using modern cryptographic techniques. It allows users to send plain or encrypted emails, where the decryption is only possible after a specified timelock period. The system leverages ML-KEM, AES encryption, hash functions, and timelock puzzles to achieve time-based security and consortium-based decryption.
